# Comparision-Of-Classifiers-On-Heart-Disease-Dataset

Heart disease is a significant global health concern, necessitating accurate predictive models for early detection. Our investigation encompasses dataset exploration, pre-processing steps, model training, evaluation, and comparative analysis of classifier performance. We address fundamental questions concerning classifier efficiency. Through meticulous data pre-processing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing numerical features, we ensure the dataset's suitability. Employing prominent classifiers such as KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, and AdaBoost, we conduct a rigorous comparative analysis of their performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Area under the ROC Curve (AUC). Our findings reveal that AdaBoost consistently outperforms other classifiers, demonstrating the highest AUC score and effectively discriminating between positive and negative heart disease cases making it the optimal choice for heart disease prediction in this study. Future research could explore ensemble methods or deep learning for improved accuracy. Expanding the feature space may also enhance performance and risk stratification.
